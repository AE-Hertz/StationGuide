# Running the Development Server

<br>

# Frontend:

- Open a terminal or command prompt window.
- Navigate to the frontend directory:
```Bash
cd frontend
```

- Start the frontend development server :
```Bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically launch the React application on http://localhost:3000 (or the specified port) in your browser.

<br>

# Backend:

- Open another terminal or command prompt window (separate from the frontend window).
- Navigate to the backend directory:
```Bash
cd backend
```

Start the backend development server (typically using nodemon server.js or a similar command):
```Bash
npm run start
```

# Good Coding Practices 🧑‍💻

1. **Follow the Project's Code Style**

   - Maintain consistency with the existing code style (indentation, spacing, comments).
   - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
   - Keep functions short and focused on a single task.
   - Avoid hardcoding values; instead, use constants or configuration files when possible.

2. **Write Clear and Concise Comments**

   - Use comments to explain why you did something, not just what you did.
   - Avoid unnecessary comments that state the obvious.
   - Document complex logic and functions with brief explanations to help others understand your thought -process.

3. **Keep Code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**

   - Avoid duplicating code. Reuse functions, methods, and components whenever possible.
   - If you find yourself copying and pasting code, consider creating a new function or component.

4. **Write Tests**

   - Write unit tests for your functions and components.
   - Ensure your tests cover both expected outcomes and edge cases.
   - Run tests locally before making a pull request to make sure your changes don’t introduce new bugs.

5. **Code Reviews and Feedback**

   - Be open to receiving constructive feedback from other contributors.
   - Conduct code reviews for others and provide meaningful suggestions to improve the code.
   - Always refactor your code based on feedback to meet the project's standards.
